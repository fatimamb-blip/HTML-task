        <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Franz Kafka</b> (1883–1924) was a <i>German-speaking writer</i>, widely regarded as one of the <b>major figures of 20th-century literature</b>. His works, including <i>"The Metamorphosis," "The Trial,"</i> and <i>"The Castle,"</i> explore themes of <b>alienation, existential anxiety,</b> and the <b>absurdity of modern life</b>. Kafka's unique style and vision have influenced countless writers and thinkers, and his legacy endures as a symbol of literary modernism.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Born into a <b>middle-class Jewish family</b> in Prague, Kafka had a difficult relationship with his domineering father. He studied <i>law at Charles University</i> and worked for an insurance company while pursuing his writing in his spare time. Despite his relatively short life, he produced a body of work that would profoundly influence 20th-century literature and philosophy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Most of his work was <b>published posthumously</b> by his friend <i>Max Brod</i>, who defied Kafka's dying wish to burn his manuscripts. This act of literary preservation gave the world some of the most important works of modern literature.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact on Literature</h2>
        <p>
          Kafka's influence extends <b>far beyond literature</b>. The term <i>"Kafkaesque"</i> has entered common usage to describe surreal, nightmarish situations characterized by complex and bureaucratic systems. His exploration of themes such as <b>guilt, anxiety,</b> and the <b>individual's struggle against impersonal forces</b> continues to resonate with readers worldwide.
